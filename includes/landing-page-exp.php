                    <small>2021 - 2022</small>
                    <p>During this phase, I delved into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                        by developing projects in Java using NetBeans IDE. This experience allowed me to
                        design and implement real-world applications, applying core OOP concepts such as
                        encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Leveraging NetBeans'
                        powerful debugging tools and user-friendly interface, I enhanced my programming
                        skills and deepened my understanding of software development methodologies.

                    <p>As part of this project, I designed and built an innovative engineering calculator
                        application using Android Studio. The app offered functionalities such as advanced
                        computations, resistor value decoding from color codes, and seamless conversion between
                        various engineering metrics (e.g., voltage, current, resistance, and more).
                        This project honed my skills in Android app development, UI/UX design, and
                        integrating real-world engineering concepts into functional software solutions.

                    <p>In this project, I developed a comprehensive barangay kiosk system to streamline local
                        services and improve accessibility. The system featured a mobile application,
                        built using Android Studio, that provided users with a convenient way to access barangay
                        information and services. Complementing the app, I designed a responsive website using
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless interaction across various devices. For
                        data storage and management, I integrated Firebase, enabling secure, real-time updates
                        and efficient handling of user data and service requests. This project demonstrated my
                        ability to combine mobile development, web technologies, and cloud-based solutions into
                        a cohesive and user-friendly system.

                    <p>I created a mobile dictionary app powered by Node.js and the Merriam-Webster API.
                        The app allowed users to search for word definitions, synonyms, and examples, providing
                        a fast and user-friendly experience. By integrating the Merriam-Webster API, I
                        ensured accurate and up-to-date linguistic data. This project enhanced my skills in
                        backend development, API integration, and building responsive, data-driven mobile applications.

                    <small>2023 - Present</small>
                    <p>I developed custom bots for Discord, enhancing server functionality and user engagement.
                        These bots were programmed to perform various tasks, such as managing moderation,
                        automating repetitive actions, providing information, and enabling interactive features
                        like games or custom commands. By leveraging Discord’s API and tools like JavaScript and
                        Python, I implemented features tailored to server needs,
                        including real-time data fetching, role management, and message handling.
                        This project strengthened my understanding of APIs, event-driven programming, and
                        creating dynamic user experiences within online communities.

                    <p>In this project, I utilized MATLAB to design and analyze a Digital Signal Processing
                        (DSP) system. The project involved implementing various DSP techniques, such as signal
                        filtering, Fourier analysis, and spectral visualization, to process and interpret
                        real-world signals. MATLAB’s extensive library of built-in functions and its powerful
                        simulation tools enabled me to model, test, and optimize the system effectively.
                        This experience deepened my understanding of signal processing concepts and demonstrated
                        the practical application of MATLAB in solving complex engineering problems.
