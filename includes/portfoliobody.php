                        <h1>Barangay Scheduling KIOSK</h1>
                        <p>In this project, I developed a comprehensive barangay kiosk system to streamline local
                            services and improve accessibility. The system featured a mobile application,
                            built using Android Studio, that provided users with a convenient way to access barangay
                            information and services. Complementing the app, I designed a responsive website using
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless interaction across various devices. For
                            data storage and management, I integrated Firebase, enabling secure, real-time updates
                            and efficient handling of user data and service requests. This project demonstrated my
                            ability to combine mobile development, web technologies, and cloud-based solutions into
                            a cohesive and user-friendly system.

                        <h1>JAAMPS Engineering Calculator</h1>
                        <p>As part of this project, I designed and built an innovative engineering calculator
                            application using Android Studio. The app offered functionalities such as advanced
                            computations, resistor value decoding from color codes, and seamless conversion between
                            various engineering metrics (e.g., voltage, current, resistance, and more).
                            This project honed my skills in Android app development, UI/UX design, and
                            integrating real-world engineering concepts into functional software solutions.

                            Node.js and the Merriam-Webster API. The app
                            allowed users to search for word definitions,
