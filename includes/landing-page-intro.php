        <h1>Meet Jay</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jay, a.k.a. Lynx, a 4th-year Computer Engineering student with a deep passion for
            technology and software development. I specialize in creating innovative solutions
            and am experienced in working with languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C,
            and C++. Along with my academic pursuits, I’m an avid gamer and streamer in my
            free time—some of my favorite games include Minecraft, Assassin's Creed, Valorant,
            and MLBB. When I'm not coding or gaming, you’ll likely find me watching movies, enjoying
            good food, or spending time with my cats.
