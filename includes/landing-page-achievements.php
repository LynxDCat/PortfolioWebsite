                <h1>Chess Tournament</h1>
                <p>During my elementary years, I had the opportunity to compete in a chess tournament
                    where I proudly placed 3rd. It was a memorable experience that sparked my love for
                    the game and strategic thinking. I enjoy exploring various chess openings, with some
                    of my favorites being the Caro-Kann, Queen's Gambit, Queen's Opening, and King's
                    Opening. These strategies have not only sharpened my skills on the chessboard but also
                    influenced my approach to problem-solving in my studies and projects. Chess remains
                    one of my favorite hobbies, blending competition with intellect.

                <h1>ICPEP Challenge</h1>
                <p>In the regional ICPEP challenge, I had the privilege of competing
                    in the C programming category, where I earned 1st runner-up. I
                    completed the entire challenge with a perfect score in under an hour,
                    well ahead of my competitors. The experience showcased not only my speed
                    and efficiency in coding but also my ability to solve complex problems
                    under time pressure. This accomplishment has been a significant milestone
                    in my journey as a programmer, reinforcing my passion for coding and sharpening
                    my problem-solving skills.

                <h1>Outstanding student</h1>
                <p>I graduated with High Honor in my senior high school year in Assembly Woman Felicita G. Bernardino
                    Memorial Trade School, a testament to my dedication and commitment to academic excellence.
                    My journey as a consistent honor student began as early as nursery,
                    and Iâ€™ve maintained that level of achievement throughout my academic career.
                    This continuous drive for success has not only shaped my work ethic but also fueled my passion
                    for learning, which I carry into my studies as a Computer Engineering student.
